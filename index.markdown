## About me
I am a final year PhD student in the
[Acoustics and Audio Group (AAG)](https://www.acoustics.ed.ac.uk/) and [Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR)](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).
My main research interest is in modelling of analog audio effects, with a focus on the intersection between tradidional digital signal processing and neural networks for this task. 
My specific areas of focus so far have been antialiasing, sample rate independent neural networks and modulation effects modelling.

My research is fully funded by the [Scottish Graduate School of Arts and Humantities (SGSAH)](https://www.sgsah.ac.uk/).

Since 2020 I have also been a teaching member of staff in the AAG, including a one year full time post as *Teaching Fellow in Acoustics* prior to starting my PhD.

I am a keen guitar player and songwriter -- currently involved in two [musical ventures](/music.md).
